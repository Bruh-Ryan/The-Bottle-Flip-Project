## Features

- **Realistic 2D Physics**: Accurate bottle rotation and movement simulation when flipped
- **Scoring System**: Track your successful bottle flips and compete for high scores
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and responsive user interface built with JavaFX
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Well-structured code following OOP principles
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any system with Java support

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **JavaFX**: GUI framework for creating the user interface and handling graphics
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Clean code architecture with proper class design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JavaFX SDK (if not included with your JDK)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd bottle-flip-game
```

2. Compile the Java files:
```bash
javac --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml *.java
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml MainClass
```

## How to Play

1. Launch the game
2. Click or use designated controls to flip the bottle
3. Try to land the bottle upright to score points
4. Challenge yourself to achieve higher scores with consecutive successful flips

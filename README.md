## Features

- **Realistic 2D Physics**: Accurate bottle rotation and movement simulation when flipped
- **Scoring System**: Track your successful bottle flips and compete for high scores
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and responsive user interface built with JavaFX
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Well-structured code following OOP principles
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any system with Java support

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language
- **JavaFX**: GUI framework for creating the user interface and handling graphics
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Clean code architecture with proper class design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven 3.6 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bruh-Ryan/The-Bottle-Flip-Project.git
cd The-Bottle-Flip-Project
```

2. Build the project using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

## How to Play

1. Launch the game
2. Click or use designated controls to flip the bottle
3. Pressing 'R' key is for rest bottle positions.
4. The Score system goes like, 1P for <1000, 2P for <4999 and 3P for >5000unit distance.
5. Try to land the bottle upright to score points
6. Challenge yourself to achieve higher scores with consecutive successful flips

## Known Issues

- **Audio Problems**: The mute/unmute functionality may cause audio glitches that can be annoying during gameplay
- Users may experience inconsistent audio behavior when toggling sound settings

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features
- **Enhanced UI Design**: Complete visual overhaul for a more modern and appealing interface
- **Sound Effects**: 
  - Individual sound effects for each bottle flip attempt
  - Button click sounds for menu interactions
  - Background music options
- **Improved Code Architecture**: Refactor codebase for better maintainability and performance
- **Visual Enhancements**: 
  - Better graphics and animations
  - Particle effects for successful flips
  - Improved bottle and background aesthetics
- **Gameplay Improvements**:
